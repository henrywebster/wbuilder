    I have not made a habit of sharing online. When I started using
    social media as a kid, it was an era of unfiltered day-to-day. I
    could understand it more because there was no thought behind it.
    I would share what I was doing, freely jettisoning content into
    a void without any idea of what could come back. Eventually this
    gave way to the ultra-manicured platforms of today, and I shrunk
    from the light. I did not enjoy the pressure of social media
    suddenly becoming my résumé, diary, photo album, and meeting
    place.
</p>
<p>
    So have I done better avoiding it as much as possible? I don't
    think so. It is a problem I have been grappling with. There used
    to be a massive distinction between regular media and the
    bottom-up world of social networking sites. As that distinction
    disintegrated, I threw in the towel instead of figuring out how
    to adapt. The fact is I do feel stifled in my work by not
    engaging at all. It's been hard to focus on long-term projects.
    I'm not seeing enough of even my own friends' work. I'm not
    discovering interesting creators. I'm not getting trickles of
    satisfaction from small wins. The longer I hole up, I can feel
    my hole getting smaller.
</p>
<p>
    I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/bQDudbp-pag">video from Venus Theory</a> and caught a glimpse of
    Austin Kleon's <cite><a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">Show Your Work</a></cite>. I had never heard of it but got
    the eBook and read it in a sprint. This book convinced me my
    lack of engagement with my process and the outside is hindering
    my ability to finish. I enjoyed the take-some-and-leave-some
    attitude of the advice. As a huge consumer of the metawork genre
    it was refreshing to get quotations from the likes of <a href="https://youtu.be/2hQW9NIaNYg"> Steve
    Albini</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/hnbneKvdBCM">Robert Pollard</a>. The tone reminded me of Michael
    Pollan's <cite><a href="https://michaelpollan.com/books/food-rules/">Food Rules</a></cite>. Both authors don't pretend to have invented
    the perfect regimen, but give simple, flexible actions distilled
    from numerous examples. I felt inspired enough to get thinking
    about ways I could pick up some of what Kleon puts down.

                Whether you share it or not, documenting and

                rewards: You'll start to see the world you're doing
                more clearly and feel like you're making progress.
                And when you're ready to share, you'll have a

        I am both aware of the power of reflection and remain
        painfully inadequate at carrying it out. It came on my radar
        after reading David Robson's <cite><a href="https://davidrobson.me/books/the-intelligence-trap/">The Intelligence Trap</a></cite>. The book
        journeys through history to explain how experts become
        victims of their own knowledge. I'm amazed at the
        explanation for their failures being they knew too much. I'm
        horrified because having mastery is supposed to mean you're
        <em>better</em>. The idea all that effort would eventually narrow
        your understanding and effectiveness felt like changing the
        laws of physics overnight. Gracefully, the book provides a
        solution: reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Robson explains how writing about what you're doing and how
        you're feeling gives “deeper introspection and the
        differentiation of your feelings” as well as helping “learn
        and remember what worked and what didn't.” I love the idea
        of acknowledging that creative works take effort and
        recording that. Sometimes I'm able to power through over
        weeks and forget what it took. Sometimes I can get a solid
        week in and end up running out of energy. Not only is the
        lack of a tangible output disheartening, but the lack of
        evidence for how and why I was doing it makes it difficult
        to pick back up in the future. Kleon's encouragement to
        record the process is engaging in creative reflection. By
        documenting my own process, I'm able to see more tangible
        output and stay motivated. I'm also leaving breadcrumbs for
        times that life gets in the way so I can get back on track.
        It's a reflective practice that will hone my process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coming to terms with this feels like the difference between
        James Bond and Luke Skywalker. Charlie Houpert makes a great
        point in his <a href="https://youtu.be/THwTUsF0yQQ">analysis of Bond and the masculine ideal</a> that
        although Bond has a bevy of abilities, we never see him
        practice. This takes away an entire dimension of Bond's
        intrigue. While it is entirely possible this is taking place
        off-screen, there are cases it is clear we are supposed to
        believe he can just do anything. Not long after getting his
        tricked-out ride in <cite>Goldfinger</cite>, he effortlessly deploys the
        gadgets against enemies despite only getting a brief rundown
        from Q. To make it more befuddling, the switches are not
        even labelled. His world believes the polished output is the
        only thing worth valuing and complete competency at first
        contact is realistic. As consciously as I would deny
        idealizing the MI6 agent, unconsciously I was stuck in this
        world. I undervalued the process and my own work as not good
        enough. I wasn't going back and figuring out what worked and
        what didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
        A protagonist we observe practice is Luke Skywalker. In
        <cite>Empire Strikes Back</cite>, Skywalker spends a grueling season in
        the jungles of Dagobah with Yoda training in the ways of the
        Force. We watch him whining, failing, and making the small
        victories that characterize practice in the real world. The
        most compelling aspect is in <cite>Return of the Jedi</cite>, when
        Skywalker returns to his mentor. He asks to complete his
        training, but Yoda refuses and says he is already ready.
        Skywalker doesn't believe it, but there's nothing he can do.
        This is the reality of creative work. It is difficult. We
        get stuck in the loop that there's always more we can do.
        The hardest part is acknowledging we're ready to let it go.
        While Skywalker is pressed by the events of the galaxy to go
        forth anyway, we don't always have the same scenario.
        Sometimes there are hard deadlines or economic concerns.
        Sometimes, however, there's nothing forcing us to complete
        the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        So now I want to document my work to remind myself that, at
        least in this area, the world is more Lucas than Flemming. I
        never get an idea that instantly turns to gold. I don't come
        across a new tool and wield it masterfully at once. I get
        underwhelmed and stuck. I scour tutorials and struggle to
        make what's in my head appear. I don't think I'm ready when
        a very well could be. By being reflective, I am more in tune
        with myself and able to make the deliberate progress needed
        to finish.

        Now that I've made a case for myself to be more cognizant of
        how I work, I have to explain why I started a blog. While
        this could have been done in a private space, Kleon's entire
        point is that it should be public. I haven't been very
        collaborative in recent years. A big reason is that I
        haven't been engaging with any communities on the internet.
        I'm hoping that by writing these posts, be they analyses or
        tutorials or journals, I can contribute to a greater scene.
        Robson also mentions teaching as a tool to improve
        understanding because “the act of explanation forces us to
        process the material more deeply.” When the blog is framed
        that others are going to see it, I'm being more deliberate
        in how I gather and organize information. Whether it's
        through direct cooperation or getting recommendations and
        feedback, being part of a community is a creative
        force-multiplier.
    </p>
    <p>
        Coming back to our two heroes, James Bond is one of the
        least collaborative characters. In <cite>Goldfinger</cite>, every
        possible supporting role is almost instantly offed. Bond is
        left to fend for himself in increasingly elaborate ways. His
        American counterparts are woefully ignorant of his
        precarious situation and figure he's got it taken care of.
        He doesn't seem to mind, but it doesn't have to be that
        hard. This isn't a desirable way to get things done, even if
        we had the cunning and cool head of 007.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luke Skywalker, however, is a part of a larger group and is
        put in situations he can't complete without aid. Despite his
        powers, in Return of the Jedi Skywalker is dependent upon
        his many co-conspirators to destroy the Death Star. As the
        operation starts in disaster, Skywalker has to watch as the
        Sith taunt him. When Sidious nearly kills him, it's up to
        Vader to save his life. This is the reality of creativity.
        There is nothing honorable about not asking for advice or
        pretending that everything we make has as little influence
        of others as possible. It's high time to be more Jedi than
        secret agent.
